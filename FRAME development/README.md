# [INTERMEDIATE CHALLENGE] FRAME Development

## Approach
Assume we have a groccery store and want to keep a balance of all kind of fruits. Our supply is defined to be 'sufficent' if we have at least 48 pieces of a type of fruit.

* The substrate node template has been updated to include the new struct to maintain storage of fruit and amounts. [here](https://github.com/developery-nl/polkadot_challenge_substrate_frame)

The front end has been updated to edit these fruit and amounts.


### Some screenshots from the interface
Below we used the interface to add 12 pieces of apples. Which is below our desired supply of 48
